I am a MSc Data Science student at LSE graduating in September, 2021. I have a pure mathematical background and did a PhD in Algebraic Geometry.

Currently I am interested in application oriented fields. In particular, in applications of Machine Learning to the modern challenges.

Please find my CV in the corresponding section.
